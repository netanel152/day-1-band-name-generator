## About

It prompts the user for the city they grew up in and the name of their pet, then combines them to suggest a unique band name.

## Key Learnings

* Using the `print()` function to display text and greet the user.
* Capturing user data from the console with the `input()` function.
* Storing text data in variables.
* Combining (concatenating) multiple strings to create a new string.
